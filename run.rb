# Central Park Zoo has just received 4 wolves. Alter the `zoos` information to reflect this new change:
# Put this hash: { species: "Wolf", count: 4 } in the array under the `:animals` key in Central Park Zoo





# The 2 penguins in the Bronx Zoo just had a baby. Alter the `zoos` information to reflect this new change:
# Increment the number for the `:count` key in the "Penguin" hash in the Bronx Zoo array by 1. 
# You can assume that the animal at index 0 will always be the "Penguin" hash.





# Each of the zoos in the city just received 2 pandas. Alter the `zoos` information to reflect this new change:
# In the array of animals under each Zoo, shovel this hash: { species: "Panda", count: 2 }





# Return the number of Tigers at the Bronx Zoo.
# Rather than assuming that the animal at index 2 will always be the "Tiger" hash:
# First find the "Tiger" hash from the array of Animals at the Bronx Zoo and then, access the value under the ":count" key






# Generalize the process to find the ticket price of a specific zoo.
# In other words, you're given a `name_of_zoo` variable that is a string.
# Return the price associated with the `name_of_zoo` variable.

# No matter which 1 of the 3 variable assignment you choose, your code should work:
# name_of_zoo = "Bronx Zoo" => returns 25
# name_of_zoo = "Central Park Zoo" => returns 18
# name_of_zoo = "Staten Island Zoo" => returns 10





# Return the sum of all the zoos' price. 
# The return value should be: 53 





# Return an array of all the locations where the zoos are located.
# The return value should be an array of strings: ["Bronx", "Manhattan", "Staten Island"]
# Consider which higher-level enumerable method(s) you'd use here.





# Find all the zoos that are open on the weekend. 
# The return value should be a hash with two keys: ["Bronx Zoo", "Central Park Zoo"]
# Consider which higher-level enumerable method(s) you'd use here.





# Find the first zoo that are open on the weekend AND has the price under 20 dollars.
# The return value should be an array with two elements: ["Central Park Zoo", { location: "Manhattan", ... }]
# Consider which higher-level enumerable method(s) you'd use here.





# Find all the zoos where there are monkeys.
# The return value should be a hash with two keys: ["Central Park Zoo", "Staten Island Zoo"]
# Consider which higher-level enumerable method(s) you'd use here.





# Return an array of 3 numbers, each describing the total sum of the number of animals in a zoo.
# The return value should be an array of 3 numbers: [20, 14, 17]
# Consider which higher-level enumerable method(s) you'd use here.





# Find the zoo with the highest count of any species in it. (Butterflies with the 12 count is the highest)
# The return value should be an array with two elements: ["Bronx Zoo", { location: "Bronx", ... }]
# Consider which higher-level enumerable method(s) you'd use here.
